                    <p>Laptops are great for web development because they are portable and you can always bring them with you. However, they can get incredibly hot during prolonged use.

                        This is why laptops come with fans that blow air over them, usually causing them to heat up. This is what you want to avoid.
                        
                        A friend of mine wanted to carry a laptop with him and was concerned about the heat it would cause. In order to limit the heat, he opted for an external case that uses silicone instead of air and keeps the laptop safe from the heat.
                        
                        What you will need to make this case is:
                        
                        A cutters blade
                        
                        A saw with a large blade
                        
                        The silicone case
                        
                        2</p>

                    <p>I am making a website and I need a name. It isn't a very big website, so I have to make a name that people will remember. I went to my high school orientation for the after school program they have there. It looks like a lot of fun. The games they do are really fun. I am so glad that I will have a chance to take classes with the other kids. The other kids look like they are a lot of fun. I think I will be a lot</p>
