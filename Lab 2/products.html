                <p>The reasoning behind the 1st product being the only one with a paragraph is because it is special compared to the rest.</p>

                <p>Also this is just because I wanted to put another story after this</p>

                <p>We are doing advanced computer science in a daycare. Our goal is to get them ready, learn, and apply. We will see what happens, and we can learn from them. We will help them develop new skills in their own way. We hope you look forward to learning from you.

                    This month's theme was "Fruit. Life is a Rainbow."
                    
                    A portion of your prize money goes to the California Teachers College. In honor of this, we're getting all of our teaching assistants to come out to our house to help teach our students. These students will be taking classes in our field, and we're looking to make sure that they get the best possible way to learn, in their own way.
                    
                    In addition, we have a scholarship program that will award 1-500 full-time faculty/staff memberships in the field, as well as full-time and part-time teachers, to our students from our community.
                    
                    There will also be a scholarship of $100,000 that goes straight to the state of California, which goes directly into the salaries of all of our teaching assistants. We still have about $750,000 left. These will help make this year a success.
                    
                    Congratulations to ALL of you for contributing to this effort.</p>
