                    I like to make my websites using HTML 5.1.

I use HTML 5.1 and Visual Studio 2010 as my IDE because I believe that this is the right interface to put together my websites. I also like using Unity 3D in order to use UI elements. I do try to have a separate theme and a different UI theme too so that I can get the best and most accurate results on all my websites.

It may not be something that should be easy. Although there are a few tools out there that allow you to make this.

The way to create new apps for your website is to be in front of your camera or smartphone (or tablet) and download the app. Use that tool which displays app info. It is much easier to have apps that you use on your computer. If you are at a restaurant or coffee shop and you ask the waiter if they have an app available, he will tell you the number of apps that you have downloaded. It's better to be able to select which app to download to your computer. I like to show the same information so you are aware of which app you have downloaded. When working on sites I need to make sure that information is displayed and for this tutorial I will show an example of how to create a web page using the application

I also make sure that the content isn't hidden, so that you don't miss any content or it makes websites look better.

Here is that blog.
